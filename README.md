# ShapeClip-Serial-Firmware 2.6

This updated serial version follows from Will Simm's hacked serial version. 
There are boundary checks and there are improvements in the way that the stepper motor approaches the target height.
This firmware can be used with the java serial shape clip API to send instructions already formatted by an array or an image.
